Ruckus ZoneDirector's default protocol for Syslog events is UDP. TCP port is not supported on the Ruckus.
Coinciding with that info, AWS's Elastic Load Balancer doesn't support UDP. Hence, the work-around was to
set up a raspberry pi that listens on it's UDP 514 port (default port for UDP) for traffic directed from Ruckus, and have the
Universal Splunk forwarder(also installed on the pi) monitor the directory where logs are saved
and forward the logs to Splunk Enterprise(production instance).
